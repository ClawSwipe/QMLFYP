Hamiltonian embedding has emerged as a powerful technique in Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) for encoding classical data into quantum states, enabling richer feature extraction and enhanced classification performance. This study investigates the impact of initialization strategies—Random, Beta,and a weighted ensemble approach—on the performance of Hamiltonian-embedded QNNs across four diverse datasets: Kaggle CT Medical Images, SKlearn Digits, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Experimental results demonstrate that Beta initialization consistently improves model optimization and generalization by mitigating barren plateaus. The ensemble approach, combining the strengths of Random and Beta initializations, further highlights the potential of hybrid strategies, with the SKlearn Digits dataset achieving optimal performance at a balanced weight. This work underscores the critical role of initialization strategies in QNNs and provides actionable insights into leveraging them for improved quantum-assisted classification tasks. Future directions include exploring dynamic ensemble weighting, evaluating initialization strategies in conjunction with alternative data encodingmethods, and applying these approaches to larger and more complex datasets.
